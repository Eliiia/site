hi

this is my personal webserver. i don't really know why you're looking at this, but i assume you're a friend of mine looking at this after i told you to??

# contributing
if you are a stranger though and you want to contribute, you should probably do it by putting up issues or suggesting things to add
you could in theory just do a pull request, but the licence is set to a simple copyright notice and also i would probably just deny it, as this is meant to be **my** project

# deployment??
(not sure what to call it)
as of writing this, the website is accessible through [here](http://gerg.club/) on my raspberry pi, and port 8080 (so [here](http://gerg.club:8080/)) is set to my pc, so any changes that i didn't put up on port 80 will be there
i love the domain name though, don't you?

anyways enjoy
